# GlucoseCam

This repo is a prototype for a grant project, aiming at automatic microfludic paper colorimetry detection. Microfluidics papers changes color upon analyte reacting with prescribed agent on the papers. The application is built as native Android app in Java, with Chaquopy plugin mediating communication with background python threads. Colored paper patch detection is achieved by computer vision techniques implemented mainly by OpenCV.
